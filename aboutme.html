        <h3 class="w3-center"><b>LARA BAILEY</b></h3>
        <p class="w3-center w3-large"><u>About Me</u><br><br>Hi, my name is Lara and I have been teaching fitness classes for 8 years at various sites in the Leicestershire area. I currently teach DANCE&TONE, INSANITY & STRETCH&TONE, Les Mills Barre, SH'BAM, BODYCOMBAT, BODYPUMP & CXWORX, along with Indoor Cycling. I am also a qualified Level 3 Personal Trainer.
        <br><br>I believe in providing workouts that will push you and help you achieve your goals but in a fun and welcoming environment. This means I believe in what I am teaching and I have seen results in myself from these programmes so want to bring this to my participants.</p>

            <p class="w3-large"><b>Group Exercise</b></p>
            <p>I started my group fitness career aged 18 where I qualified in Exercise to Music, giving me the oportunity to create my own choreography as well as teach my own fitness classes.
            <br><br>This soon led onto me starting my Les Mills journey and taking my BODYCOMBAT qualification shortly followed by BODYJAM and later I qualified in SH'BAM, BODYPUMP, BODYBALANCE and CXWORX.
            <br<br>I qualified in Zumba in 2010 and then took on the childrens format "Zumbatomic". This helped me by introducing me to creating my own freestyle routines and gave me the confidence to create the routines for my DANCE&TONE classes today.
            <br><br>Beachbody came into my life in 2014 when I trained in INSANITY followed the next year by their new programme PiYO.
            <br><br>I have been lucky enough to have been selected for the Les Mills presenter bootcamp twice, as well as been made a Les Mills Tribe Coach, and shadow on stage with the Programme director for SH'BAM in front or hundereds of instructors and participants at Alexandra Palace, London and in New Zealand. I have also represented Nuffield Health Leicester at the Gay Pride event in Leicester with collegues and participants from the club.
            <br><br>I love my job and love being able to help people achieve their goals, hear their fitness journeys and help create a fitter and happier place for people to thrive in. </p>

            <p class="w3-large"><b>Dancing</b></p>
            <p>I started dancing age 3 and continued to take part in dance classes, with a gap where I switched and took gymnastics classes for a couple of years, until the age of 15. I achieved grades 1-3 in ballet and grades 1-5 in tap as well as my completing gymnastics grades 5-1 too.
            <br><br>I have always had a love of dance and movement with music and love trying out new dances as well as challenging myself by creating choreography for my DANCE&TONE classes. </p>

            <p class="w3-large"><b>Tae Kwon Do</b></p>
            <p>I started Tae Kwon Do age 13 and continued this until I was 22 where I could no longer attend classes due to my fitness classes taking over.
            <br><br>During this time I achieved my 2nd degree Black Belt, became British champion in Patterns as well as placing in top 3 in other regional competions in patterns and team patterns. I have also umpired many large competitions around the United Kingdom.
            <br><br>This is where my love of martial arts started and has helped me with my flexibility and technique for my BODYCOMBAT classes.</p>

            <p class="w3-large">Personal Training</p>
            <p>I will be offering Personal Training sessions. I am only available for a small amount of sessions available I will be looking for people who are willing to put the work in and see a difference in their fitness. We can work towards a challenge you have signed up for or any fitness goals you would like to achieve. Sessions can be tailored around children if you have them or can be done with a partner/friend for a special price if you do not like working out alone.</p>
