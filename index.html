      <p>Its essential in this time of isolation that we stay connected to the outside world, fortunately we have the endless technology that
        allows this to happen now. FaceTime, Skype, Hangout, Zoom.. just to name a few basic ones - but then there have been those created like
        'HouseParty' that allows users to play games together whilst in use. It is just great that we have the ability to do this and keep our
        <b>sanity.</b></p>
      <p>We spoke to our friends Sam and Leon in New Zealand last night using FaceTime and was great to catch up with them an their beautiful daughter Mo√±ika.
        It was great to catch up with them and chat, they are also on lockdown but things seem a little more relaxed there as not yet had any deaths.
        Lockdown was implemented much quicker there and seems to be more adhered to than we are in the UK.</p>
      <p>Lara talks to her parents each morning and lets them see Luna which is great in a time where they are unable to visit us even though they live just
        around the corner. My family has a Whatsapp group that allows us to keep in touch to check all okay, and are planning a group FaceTime so that can
        chat face to face.</p>
      <p>What keeps me sane during this time..my wife and daughter! and only the mass amount of movies & TV shows able to watch, currently binge watching 'Grey's Anatomy'
        :D</p>
      <p>Hope you all have something or someone that helps keep you sane during this time.</p>

      <h3><b>LOCKDOWN</b></h3>
      <span class="w3-opacity">Tuesday 24th March</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Last night it was announced that the country would be put on lockdown. This put strict guidelines for leaving the house.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Stay at home</b> - No unnecessary journeys or social distancing.</li>
      <li>Only leave the house for <b>essential shopping</b> or <b>medical needs</b></li>
      <li>One form of exercise per day <b>(eg. Walk, Run, Cycle)</b></li>
      <li>No <b>travelling to work</b> unless <b>absolutly neccessary</b></li>
      <li>Public gatherings of <b>more than two people are banned</b> (excluding people you live with)</li>
      <li><b>Police can fine you</b> if you don't follow the rules</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These guidelines have been a long time coming and really hope that they are adhered to, unfortunately we know that certain few will not and expect
      that further and more stricter guidelines will be put in place</p>
      <p>The death toll is rising, now at <b>335 deaths.</b> How is this not scaring people to act more responsible?! We should be protecting ourselves, our loved
        ones and family. It must be tough for families that live in seperate households, thank god for technology like FaceTime and Skype that allows them to keep
        in touch and talk, definately helping to cope with the <i>cabin fever.</i></p>
        <p>It seems the best thing we can do is to keep our minds active, make use of our gardens while its hot, spring clean the house now so that when
          able to move more freely then can make the most of it... and relax</p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Working from home is not all is cracked up to be, it initially feels great as you have all your creature comforts, but then you take for granted
      a lot of things you can do so easily in the office. I also feel like you can develop a little bit of cabin fever, and feel a little lonely.</p>
      <p>I woke this morning a little later than normal, but still wanted to continue a morning routine of getting showered and dressed. It did feel a little
        less rushed than normal as didnt have to drive anywhere, but Im now sitting at my desk early eating a bowl of cereal and ready to work...</p>
        <p>Hope you all have a great day, and stay safe!</p>

      <span class="w3-opacity">Saturday 21st March</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>It felt weird today, this morning I woke up later than normal.. this was because I had no classes to go teach, and it felt weird!</p>
      <p>It's a rare occasion when I get to sleep in on a Saturday, previously this was due to my previous job, and now due to teaching Les Mills classes.
        I wonder what normal people do on a Saturday when they don't go to a gym or fitness class. So far, I woke with my daughter Luna, played downstairs
        with her whilst watching '<b>Shaun of the Dead</b>'. (<i>I know, not the best film to watch with the current situation</i>)</p>
        <p>It's mothers day tomorrow, so need to find a shop somewhere to get my mum a gift, and also a gift from Luna to Lara. It does feel weird though
          that we might not see our mothers tomorrow due to the isolation, normally restaurants and pubs will be heaving with family's celebrating, but
          that won't be the same this year.</p>
          <p>Time to spend some quality time with my family now, see you all in my next post</p>

      <p>Today is the last day <i>(for now)</i> that I will be working in the office, we have been told to now work from home</p>
        <p>It is a new experience, once seen to be a great thing to do, but now, for me, quite <i>lonely.</i></p>
        <p>It is nice to know that I can spend more time at home with Lara and Luna, have lunch with them and
          be able to just come downstairs when finished for the day. Whilst we shall be saving money with not having to drive
          anywhere, we shall possibly see that increase in electric.</p>
          <p>I have now stopped teaching my exercise classes for now, which means that I won't have any reason to leave the house.
          My best intention is to ensure that I am walking on my lunch hour so that I get fresh air and exercise.</p>

      <p>Hi there, my name is Dan and welcome to my blog.</p>
        <p>I have started this blog during the times of the Coronavirus to self document the time/experience, and to also help keep
      me sane. I'm using this as a release to my thoughts and concerns, and also a way to keep my mind busy.</p>
      <p>I have a quite keen interest in web design so have created this page myself using skills I have self taught myself, always good
        during these times to make use and learn something new.</p>
      <p>Hope you enjoy reading and remember <b>Stay at home, Protect the NHS, Save lives</b></p>
