      <h3><b>Furlough</b></h3>
     <span class="w3-opacity w3-text-red"><b>Thursday 2nd April</span></b></h5>

 <div class="w3-container">
 <p>Its been a while since I last posted, this has been because have had a lot to do at with work. I found out on Monday that I will be
  furloughed from my job, this means that I will not be needed to work and will be paid only 80% of my wages from the government.</p>
  <p>I know I'm not the only one having this done as a lot of people around the world are, but to me this felt crap! Half of me thought
   great, I get to spend more time with my wife and daughter, our outgoings are less now so 80% should be fine, even though my wife comes
   off maternity pay this month. The other half felt like I was being fired, like I wouldn't have a job to go back to.. I wouln't be able
   to support my wife and child, I was quite worried.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, due to some responsibilities that I have at Aggregate, my furlough does not start until the beggining of May, and I am lucky
  to have one more month of full pay before it drops. In my head that also means that maybe in a months time things might change and employees
    might start returning..we shall see.</p>
  <p>Lara has started to do online classes to earn a few extra pennies, this is great for us and more importantly her, gives her something to do
   whilst in isolation, and also continue her business, which has been affected.</p>
  <p>Its worrying times for all and hope that everyone is okay...</p>

      <h3><b>My trip to Tesco's</b></h3>
     <span class="w3-opacity w3-text-red"><b>Monday 30th March</span></b></h5>
   <hr>

 <div class="w3-container">
 <p>Yesterday, I had to make an <b>essential</b> trip to Tesco's to collect food. I was initially happy abou this as not been out the house
 much and nice to get out..further than our estate, I later regretted this...</p>
 <p>My drive there, I was happy to see that the roads were quiet, seems that more are taking the advice and staying at home. I arrived
  at Tesco and could see that they had setup a one way in/out system, so walked in and grabbed a basket. It was at this point I checked the
  shopping list that Lara had wanted me to get and the list was as long as my arm. I then thought best get a trolley, but as I don't carry cash
  around with me, I didn't have a coin to use to get one! So there I go, two baskets one in each hand and having to stop every few minutes to check
  the shopping list, my arms getting longer and longer as the baskets got heavier. What a palava!</p>
 <p>Now, I give it to Tesco, they had marked on the ground two meter marks, they had a lot of stock as were enforcing an only three of an item policy,
  and I was able to get quite a lot of my list, including the gluten free items for my wife. People were avoiding me.. I'm used to that anyway, but everyone was being civil and happy, it's nice
  to see in such situation we are all in.</p>
 <p>I made it to the till with my two baskets, lines on the ground ensuring each customer kept their distance, my stuff scanned and processed, Â£70!! hadn't realised how much I had got.
  packed my things into bags and out to my car. Lara did insist on wiping down each product when I got home as was immediately told to go shower and put my clothes in
  the wash</p>
 <p>It wasn't a great experience but essential to ensure have food in the house.</p>

      <p>Hi there, my name is Dan and welcome to my blog.</p>
        <p>I have started this blog during the times of the Coronavirus to self document the time/experience, and to also help keep
      me sane. I'm using this as a release to my thoughts and concerns, and also a way to keep my mind busy.</p>
      <p>I have a quite keen interest in web design so have created this page myself using skills I have self taught myself, always good
        during these times to make use and learn something new.</p>
      <p>Hope you enjoy reading and remember<br><b>Stay at home, Protect the NHS, Save lives</b></p>
