            <h4 class="post-title">First Saturday with no classes... and a lie in</h4>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>It felt weird today, this morning I woke up later than normal.. this was because I had no classes to go teach, and it felt weird!</p>
              <p>It's a rare occasion when I get to sleep in on a Saturday, previously this was due to my previous job, and now due to teaching Les Mills classes.
                I wonder what normal people do on a Saturday when they don't go to a gym or fitness class. So far, I woke with my daughter Luna, played downstairs
                with her whilst watching '<b>Shaun of the Dead</b>'. (<i>I know, not the best film to watch with the current situation</i>)</p>
                <p>It's mothers day tomorrow, so need to find a shop somewhere to get my mum a gift, and also a gift from Luna to Lara. It does feel weird though
                  that we might not see our mothers tomorrow due to the isolation, normally restaurants and pubs will be heaving with family's celebrating, but
                  that won't be the same this year.</p>
                  <p>Time to spend some quality time with my family now, see you all in my next post</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Today is the last day <i>(for now)</i> that I will be working in the office, we have been told to now work from home</p>
              <p>It is a new experience, once seen to be a great thing to do, but now, for me, quite <i>lonely.</i></p>
              <p>It is nice to know that I can spend more time at home with Lara and Luna, have lunch with them and
                be able to just come downstairs when finished for the day. Whilst we shall be saving money with not having to drive
                anywhere, we shall possibly see that increase in electric.</p>
                <p>I have now stopped teaching my exercise classes for now, which means that I won't have any reason to leave the house.
                My best intention is to ensure that I am walking on my lunch hour so that I get fresh air and exercise.</p>
