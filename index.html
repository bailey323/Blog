      <h3><b>Furlough</b></h3>
     <span class="w3-opacity w3-text-red"><b>Thursday 2nd April</span></b></h5>
   <hr>
    </div>
 
 <div class="w3-container">
 <p>Its been a while since I last posted, this has been because have had a lot to do at with work. I found out on Monday that I will be
  furloughed from my job, this means that I will not be needed to work and will be paid only 80% of my wages from the government.</p>
  <p>I know I'm not the only one having this done as a lot of people around the world are, but to me this felt crap! Half of me thought
   great, I get to spend more time with my wife and daughter, our outgoings are less now so 80% should be fine, even though my wife comes
   off maternity pay this month. The other half felt like I was being fired, like I wouldn't have a job to go back to.. I wouln't be able
   to support my wife and child, I was quite worried.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, due to some responsibilities that I have at Aggregate, my furlough does not start until the beggining of May, and I am lucky
  to have one more month of full pay before it drops. In my head that also means that maybe in a months time things might change and employees
    might start returning..we shall see.</p>
  <p>Lara has started to do online classes to earn a few extra pennies, this is great for us and more importantly her, gives her something to do
   whilst in isolation, and also continue her business, which has been affected.</p>
  <p>Its worrying times for all and hope that everyone is okay...</p>

      <h3><b>My trip to Tesco's</b></h3>
     <span class="w3-opacity w3-text-red"><b>Monday 30th March</span></b></h5>
   <hr>
    </div>
 
 <div class="w3-container">
 <p>Yesterday, I had to make an <b>essential</b> trip to Tesco's to collect food. I was initially happy abou this as not been out the house
 much and nice to get out..further than our estate, I later regretted this...</p>
 <p>My drive there, I was happy to see that the roads were quiet, seems that more are taking the advice and staying at home. I arrived
  at Tesco and could see that they had setup a one way in/out system, so walked in and grabbed a basket. It was at this point I checked the
  shopping list that Lara had wanted me to get and the list was as long as my arm. I then thought best get a trolley, but as I don't carry cash
  around with me, I didn't have a coin to use to get one! So there I go, two baskets one in each hand and having to stop every few minutes to check
  the shopping list, my arms getting longer and longer as the baskets got heavier. What a palava!</p>
 <p>Now, I give it to Tesco, they had marked on the ground two meter marks, they had a lot of stock as were enforcing an only three of an item policy,
  and I was able to get quite a lot of my list, including the gluten free items for my wife. People were avoiding me.. I'm used to that anyway, but everyone was being civil and happy, it's nice
  to see in such situation we are all in.</p>
 <p>I made it to the till with my two baskets, lines on the ground ensuring each customer kept their distance, my stuff scanned and processed, £70!! hadn't realised how much I had got.
  packed my things into bags and out to my car. Lara did insist on wiping down each product when I got home as was immediately told to go shower and put my clothes in
  the wash</p>
 <p>It wasn't a great experience but essential to ensure have food in the house.</p>

     <p>We all joined in the 'Clap for NHS workers' last night, even Luna did! It was great to hear all joining in around us and definitely
     needed as they are doing such an amazing and tough job. I checked Facebook after and seeing peoples videos of all joining in across the
     country was definitely heart warming. We should do this every week to help show our support and lift our spirits!</p>
     <p>My uncle Chris is a paramedic over in Ireland, and he talks about his calls that they have to always wear PPE when dealing with incidents
      now. My aunt Judy is a nurse and is still going on home visits to check on patients..and my step-mum Wendy who also is visiting patients..
      I applaud all of them during this time that they continue to do this and not choose to isolate themselves.</p>
     <p>I also think its amazing of those who have volunteered in the past few days, either doing over the phone check in's on isolated patients,
      distributing medication to vunerable people...simply awesome people!</p>

     <p class="w3-text-red"><b>UPDATE</b></p>
      <p>It has just been announced that Boris Johnson has tested positive for Coronavirus, had shown mild symptoms and will be self isolating in Downing
       Street. He has stated that he will continue to lead the government's response via video-conferencing as we fight this virus.</p>
     <br>
     <p>Good on you Boris, joining us and working from home! haha! No, I really suppot Boris so far in his efforts and actions in the event of
      the pandemic. In my opinion I feel he's doing a good job, and has a tough job on his shoulders.</p>

      <h3><b>Importance of Excercise</b></h3>
     <span class="w3-opacity w3-text-red"><b>Thursday 26th March</span></b></h5>
   <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>It is important that during our time of isolation that we still find time to exercise and remain active, I find this more important
     as each day goes by.</p>
     <p>Having a second job as a group exercise instructor, and finding due to the gym closures that am no longer teaching my weekly classes,
      my exercise level has gone down. I am finding myself sitting down at my desk throughout the day and then sitting down on the couch in
      the evenings.. not much exercise there hey! It is now that I find myself finishing work at 5pm, and then going out for a walk with my wife
      and daughter, not only that but take regular walks around the house and garden, getting away from my desk and screens.</p>
     <p>I find that this helps me to remain calm and relaxed.. and generally happier. I advise you all to do the same.</p>
     <p>We also had a family chat on FaceTime last night which was great, lovely to see all the family. It was also great to see my brother, it
      was his birthday yesterday and rather being able to celebrate, open presents (even get presents), his day was spent in isolation and
      celebrating on his own. I will probably be doing the same in couple of weeks when my birthday comes around</p>
     <p>Make sure you all get out the house for your one exercise a day, remembering social distancing from others, and stop yourself from going
      mad</p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Its essential in this time of isolation that we stay connected to the outside world, fortunately we have the endless technology that
        allows this to happen now. FaceTime, Skype, Hangout, Zoom.. just to name a few basic ones - but then there have been those created like
        'HouseParty' that allows users to play games together whilst in use. It is just great that we have the ability to do this and keep our
        <b>sanity.</b></p>
      <p>We spoke to our friends Sam and Leon in New Zealand last night using FaceTime and was great to catch up with them an their beautiful daughter Moñika.
        It was great to catch up with them and chat, they are also on lockdown but things seem a little more relaxed there as not yet had any deaths.
        Lockdown was implemented much quicker there and seems to be more adhered to than we are in the UK.</p>
      <p>Lara talks to her parents each morning and lets them see Luna which is great in a time where they are unable to visit us even though they live just
        around the corner. My family has a Whatsapp group that allows us to keep in touch to check all okay, and are planning a group FaceTime so that can
        chat face to face.</p>
      <p>What keeps me sane during this time...my wife and daughter! and only the mass amount of movies & TV shows able to watch, currently binge watching 'Grey's Anatomy'
        :D</p>
      <p>Hope you all have something or someone that helps keep you sane during this time.</p>

      <span class="w3-opacity w3-text-red">Tuesday 24th March</span></h5>
   <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Last night it was announced that the country would be put on lockdown. This put strict guidelines for leaving the house.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Stay at home</b> - No unnecessary journeys or social distancing.</li>
      <li>Only leave the house for <b>essential shopping</b> or <b>medical needs</b></li>
      <li>One form of exercise per day <b>(eg. Walk, Run, Cycle)</b></li>
      <li>No <b>travelling to work</b> unless <b>absolutly neccessary</b></li>
      <li>Public gatherings of <b>more than two people are banned</b> (excluding people you live with)</li>
      <li><b>Police can fine you</b> if you don't follow the rules</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These guidelines have been a long time coming and really hope that they are adhered to, unfortunately we know that certain few will not and expect
      that further and more stricter guidelines will be put in place</p>
      <p>The death toll is rising, now at <b>335 deaths.</b> How is this not scaring people to act more responsible?! We should be protecting ourselves, our loved
        ones and family. It must be tough for families that live in seperate households, thank god for technology like FaceTime and Skype that allows them to keep
        in touch and talk, definately helping to cope with the <i>cabin fever.</i></p>
        <p>It seems the best thing we can do is to keep our minds active, make use of our gardens while its hot, spring clean the house now so that when
          able to move more freely then can make the most of it... and relax</p>

      <p>Working from home is not all is cracked up to be, it initially feels great as you have all your creature comforts, but then you take for granted
      a lot of things you can do so easily in the office. I also feel like you can develop a little bit of cabin fever, and feel a little lonely.</p>
      <p>I woke this morning a little later than normal, but still wanted to continue a morning routine of getting showered and dressed. It did feel a little
        less rushed than normal as didnt have to drive anywhere, but Im now sitting at my desk early eating a bowl of cereal and ready to work...</p>

      <p>It felt weird today, this morning I woke up later than normal.. this was because I had no classes to go teach, and it felt weird!</p>
      <p>It's a rare occasion when I get to sleep in on a Saturday, previously this was due to my previous job, and now due to teaching Les Mills classes.
        I wonder what normal people do on a Saturday when they don't go to a gym or fitness class. So far, I woke with my daughter Luna, played downstairs
        with her whilst watching '<b>Shaun of the Dead</b>'. (<i>I know, not the best film to watch with the current situation</i>)</p>
        <p>It's mothers day tomorrow, so need to find a shop somewhere to get my mum a gift, and also a gift from Luna to Lara. It does feel weird though
          that we might not see our mothers tomorrow due to the isolation, normally restaurants and pubs will be heaving with family's celebrating, but
          that won't be the same this year.</p>
          <p>Time to spend some quality time with my family now, see you all in my next post</p>
