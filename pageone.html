     <p>We all joined in the 'Clap for NHS workers' last night, even Luna did! It was great to hear all joining in around us and definitely
     needed as they are doing such an amazing and tough job. I checked Facebook after and seeing peoples videos of all joining in across the
     country was definitely heart warming. We should do this every week to help show our support and lift our spirits!</p>
     <p>My uncle Chris is a paramedic over in Ireland, and he talks about his calls that they have to always wear PPE when dealing with incidents
      now. My aunt Judy is a nurse and is still going on home visits to check on patients..and my step-mum Wendy who also is visiting patients..
      I applaud all of them during this time that they continue to do this and not choose to isolate themselves.</p>
     <p>I also think its amazing of those who have volunteered in the past few days, either doing over the phone check in's on isolated patients,
      distributing medication to vunerable people...simply awesome people!</p>

     <p class="w3-text-red"><b>UPDATE</b></p>
      <p>It has just been announced that Boris Johnson has tested positive for Coronavirus, had shown mild symptoms and will be self isolating in Downing
       Street. He has stated that he will continue to lead the government's response via video-conferencing as we fight this virus.</p>
     <br>
     <p>Good on you Boris, joining us and working from home! haha! No, I really suppot Boris so far in his efforts and actions in the event of
      the pandemic. In my opinion I feel he's doing a good job, and has a tough job on his shoulders.</p>

      <h3><b>Importance of Excercise</b></h3>

      <p>It is important that during our time of isolation that we still find time to exercise and remain active, I find this more important
     as each day goes by.</p>
     <p>Having a second job as a group exercise instructor, and finding due to the gym closures that am no longer teaching my weekly classes,
      my exercise level has gone down. I am finding myself sitting down at my desk throughout the day and then sitting down on the couch in
      the evenings.. not much exercise there hey! It is now that I find myself finishing work at 5pm, and then going out for a walk with my wife
      and daughter, not only that but take regular walks around the house and garden, getting away from my desk and screens.</p>
     <p>I find that this helps me to remain calm and relaxed.. and generally happier. I advise you all to do the same.</p>
     <p>We also had a family chat on FaceTime last night which was great, lovely to see all the family. It was also great to see my brother, it
      was his birthday yesterday and rather being able to celebrate, open presents (even get presents), his day was spent in isolation and
      celebrating on his own. I will probably be doing the same in couple of weeks when my birthday comes around</p>
     <p>Make sure you all get out the house for your one exercise a day, remembering social distancing from others, and stop yourself from going
      mad</p>

      <p>Its essential in this time of isolation that we stay connected to the outside world, fortunately we have the endless technology that
        allows this to happen now. FaceTime, Skype, Hangout, Zoom.. just to name a few basic ones - but then there have been those created like
        'HouseParty' that allows users to play games together whilst in use. It is just great that we have the ability to do this and keep our
        <b>sanity.</b></p>
      <p>We spoke to our friends Sam and Leon in New Zealand last night using FaceTime and was great to catch up with them an their beautiful daughter Moñika.
        It was great to catch up with them and chat, they are also on lockdown but things seem a little more relaxed there as not yet had any deaths.
        Lockdown was implemented much quicker there and seems to be more adhered to than we are in the UK.</p>
      <p>Lara talks to her parents each morning and lets them see Luna which is great in a time where they are unable to visit us even though they live just
        around the corner. My family has a Whatsapp group that allows us to keep in touch to check all okay, and are planning a group FaceTime so that can
        chat face to face.</p>
      <p>What keeps me sane during this time...my wife and daughter! and only the mass amount of movies & TV shows able to watch, currently binge watching 'Grey's Anatomy'
        :D</p>
      <p>Hope you all have something or someone that helps keep you sane during this time.</p>
