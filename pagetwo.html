      <h3><b>LOCKDOWN</b></h3>
      <span class="w3-opacity w3-text-red">Tuesday 24th March</span></h5>
   <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Last night it was announced that the country would be put on lockdown. This put strict guidelines for leaving the house.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Stay at home</b> - No unnecessary journeys or social distancing.</li>
      <li>Only leave the house for <b>essential shopping</b> or <b>medical needs</b></li>
      <li>One form of exercise per day <b>(eg. Walk, Run, Cycle)</b></li>
      <li>No <b>travelling to work</b> unless <b>absolutly neccessary</b></li>
      <li>Public gatherings of <b>more than two people are banned</b> (excluding people you live with)</li>
      <li><b>Police can fine you</b> if you don't follow the rules</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These guidelines have been a long time coming and really hope that they are adhered to, unfortunately we know that certain few will not and expect
      that further and more stricter guidelines will be put in place</p>
      <p>The death toll is rising, now at <b>335 deaths.</b> How is this not scaring people to act more responsible?! We should be protecting ourselves, our loved
        ones and family. It must be tough for families that live in seperate households, thank god for technology like FaceTime and Skype that allows them to keep
        in touch and talk, definately helping to cope with the <i>cabin fever.</i></p>
        <p>It seems the best thing we can do is to keep our minds active, make use of our gardens while its hot, spring clean the house now so that when
          able to move more freely then can make the most of it... and relax</p>
      <p><b>Stay at home, Protect the NHS, Save lives</b></p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Working from home is not all is cracked up to be, it initially feels great as you have all your creature comforts, but then you take for granted
      a lot of things you can do so easily in the office. I also feel like you can develop a little bit of cabin fever, and feel a little lonely.</p>
      <p>I woke this morning a little later than normal, but still wanted to continue a morning routine of getting showered and dressed. It did feel a little
        less rushed than normal as didnt have to drive anywhere, but Im now sitting at my desk early eating a bowl of cereal and ready to work...</p>
        <p>Hope you all have a great day, and stay safe!</p>

      <h3><b>First Saturday with no classes... and a lie in</b></h3>
      <span class="w3-opacity w3-text-red">Saturday 21st March</span></h5>
   <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>It felt weird today, this morning I woke up later than normal.. this was because I had no classes to go teach, and it felt weird!</p>
      <p>It's a rare occasion when I get to sleep in on a Saturday, previously this was due to my previous job, and now due to teaching Les Mills classes.
        I wonder what normal people do on a Saturday when they don't go to a gym or fitness class. So far, I woke with my daughter Luna, played downstairs
        with her whilst watching '<b>Shaun of the Dead</b>'. (<i>I know, not the best film to watch with the current situation</i>)</p>
        <p>It's mothers day tomorrow, so need to find a shop somewhere to get my mum a gift, and also a gift from Luna to Lara. It does feel weird though
          that we might not see our mothers tomorrow due to the isolation, normally restaurants and pubs will be heaving with family's celebrating, but
          that won't be the same this year.</p>
          <p>Time to spend some quality time with my family now, see you all in my next post</p>
